Automated tests written in RobotFramework and (sometimes) Python for my assignments to get a job as test automation engineer.
 - First assignment: 'find job offer on careers page'
 - Second assignment: 'test file commander' (NOTE: needs customized mimeTypes.rdf for Firefox to automatically download the file without asking)
 - Templates: demo of RobotFramework and radish-bbd. They doesn't test anything but can serve as demo and templates for future tests
